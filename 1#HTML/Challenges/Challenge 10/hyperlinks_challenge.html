        <h1>What I have learnt</h1>
        <p>
          My HTML experience started off quite straight-fowardly. It started out
          with me learning about how HTML tags influence how a web browser
          interprets how your information should be displayed. These tags give
          the web browser specific instructions as to where it should go and
          what it actually is. This for me was really enlightening, as it gave
          me a glimpse as to how computers operate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's talk headings. To specify that an element should be a heading, a
          simple [h] tag will suffice. Now, the way headings work is -- they
          run from 1 to 6, with 1 being the most important and biggest and 6
          being the least important ans the smallest heading. This concept is
          really simple and should be understood without much effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have paragraphs. They have the same tag function, but unlike
          headings, they do not require you to specify their importance as
          paragraphs have the same level of vitality. They are initiated with a
          simple [p] tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information can be listed. So, when it comes to listing we have the
          ordered and the unordered list. Both of them start out with the [li]
          tag. Now, for a unordered list, you further specify a [ul] tag and
          for a ordered list, you further specify a [ol] tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time for images. When comes to importing images onto a webpage, you
          can either use a url link or a directory from your personal server.
          It's much safer to link images from your personal server as the site
          that you're linking from might break and therefore stop your image
          from being displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you need your data tabulated? If so, HTML has a table function
          that is started with a [table] tag. Furthermore, your table is
          divided into columns and rows -- so you'll a few more tags. Those
          would be the [tr], [th] and [td] tags. This would be a little too
          much to explain in one go, so contact me for further clarification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, there will be forms to be made -- especially if your an
          entrepreneur looking to gather data about what your customers'
          preferances are and what improvements you as a business owner can
          make.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          HTML intiles many things -- many more things that I will be learning
          further into the coming future. As for now, there a few other things
          I know.

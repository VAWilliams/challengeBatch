      So this is me just playing around with the paragraph tag a bit. I wouldn't <br>
      say its a boring experince, but it does tend to become repetitive after <br>
      some time. Let's just say - I'm getting used to it and it's tricks and <br>
      challenges.

      HTML to me is something I ended up being frightened of. This is because, <br>
      when I look at all of the websites that are around these days, they look <br>
      so fancy and it just makes me think that making them requires a lot of <br>
      effort.

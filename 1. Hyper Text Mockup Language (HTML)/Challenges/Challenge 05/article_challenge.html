      We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen<br>
      time. The answers were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful.

      “I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as is <br>
      my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies. Not wanting <br>
      to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, holds it in his <br>
      hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone. It is the cutest/most pathetic <br>
      thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her small child’s <br>
      burgeoning tech addiction. Like most parents, that mom lives a waking life <br>
      seeped in almost non-stop screen time (an average American adult spends <br>
      about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen/index.html">11 hours a day looking at a screen</a>). She, like many modern parents, <br>
      sees her own tech dependency reflected in her children’s habits. She doesn’t <br>
      always like what she sees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as we learn about the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40520843/silicon-valley-technology-regulate-gadgets-and-apps-like-cigarettes">potential pitfalls</a> of our increasingly technology- <br>
      addled lifestyles, our dependence on tech shows little sign of waning. Still, <br>
      the anti-screen time drumbeat is getting louder, especially when it comes to <br>
      kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early <br>
      employee at Facebook, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40506058/former-facebook-exec-social-media-is-ripping-apart-society">said that the social network was “ripping apart the<br>
      social fabric of how society works.”</a> Tristan Harris, a former product <br>
      manager at Google, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/">told Wired</a> that Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, <br>
      Twitter, and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time and attention. <br>
      In January, two Apple investors asked the company to study the health <br>
      effects of its products on children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from <br>
      some the most powerful tech companies–including Apple, Google, and <br>
      Facebook–formed the <a href="http://humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a>. In partnership with <br>
      the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, the group <br>
      plans to lobby against addictive tech, and is kicking off with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40526553/truth-about-tech-campaign-aims-to-pressure-tech-giants-to-make-less-addictive-products">a $7 million<br>
      “Truth about Tech” ad campaign</a> that they plan to deliver to 55,000 public <br>
      schools.

    <p>
      That the very people who championed the technology to which we are <br>
      addicted are now banding together to warn parents about the monster <br>
      they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to question <br>
      tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad <br>
      campaign, no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our <br>
      society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are being introduced to <br>
      screens at such a young age. In her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Screen-Time-Balance-Digital/dp/1610396723">The Art of Screen Time</a> Anya <br>
      Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds) that <br>
      found that young kids spend about four hours a day in the company of (all <br>
      types of) screens.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast <br>
      Company surveyed nearly 400 parents. We tried to look at the issue from <br>
      all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types of <br>
      devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology, to <br>
      the benefits that technology can provide to families. We also asked parents <br>
      how they feel about witnessing their own tech addiction reflected in their <br>
      kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the most telling answers of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a few <br>
      other countries). Their professions span many industries, including <br>
      marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video production, <br>
      law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or two children, <br>
      ranging from 7 months to 18 years old. The majority of participants’ kids <br>
      are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these parents are in the <br>
      thick of parenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers isn’t a <br>
      conclusive sample–but, along with expert research, these parents’ insights <br>
      help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents in our tech-<br>
      dependent era.

    <h2>DO SCREENS MAKE KIDS LESS SOCIAL AND LESS CREATIVE?</h2>
    <p>
      Even if it involves lots of virtual interaction via social networks and texting, <br>
      using a screen can be a pretty solo activity. Using smartphones, tablets, and <br>
      even computers aren’t generally as communal as watching a TV with your <br>
      family.
    </p>

      <hr>
    <p>
      TV has been around a long time. For many of us, it is the devil <br>
      we know and, unlike other screened devices, it’s arguably easier <br>
      for parents to know what their children are watching on TV than <br>
      it is for parents to know what their kids are looking at on the <br>
      internet. In fact, as crazy as it might sound, we’ve reached a <br>
      point where some parents actually wish their kids were <br>
      watching more TV.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would love them to watch TV, at least it is more social since <br>
      they will watch it with their siblings or friends! I never thought I <br>
      would ever be encouraging this, but [watching TV] is much <br>
      better than being locked in your own room with your own <br>
      iPhone having an isolated life,” wrote a London dad of three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, many of our readers told us that they feel that tech <br>
      has squashed their kids’ creativity–and turned them into little <br>
      monsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I purchased a tablet for my oldest child at the age of 9. She <br>
      stopped using her imagination, she very abruptly stopped <br>
      drawing, and very quickly it became a daily battle to limit her <br>
      time on the tablet,” wrote an environmental biologist from <br>
      Pennsylvania who has three kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dad and executive from Chicago, also with three kids, <br>
      interprets it this way: “[The] smartphone takes over a child’s <br>
      daily consciousness. Natural[ly] voracious, inquisitive curiosity <br>
      seekers slowly, invariably, and inevitably become young people <br>
      indifferent to discovery in favor of scrolling. Smartphones numb <br>
      creativity, intellectual critical thought, and social growth.”

      <h2>BEING A ROLE MODEL IS SCARY</h2>
    <p>
      A lot of parenting can be a battle of “do what I say, not what I <br>
      do”–and nowhere is this more evident than in parents’ use of <br>
      tech. Many parents in our survey said their device dependency <br>
      makes them feel like hypocrites when they try to limit their kids’ <br>
      tech use. “My main regret is how much we use phones in front <br>
      of them,” wrote a mom of two from Minnesota who doesn’t <br>
      allow any screen time for her two young children.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see myself reaching for my phone out of habit anytime I’m the <br>
      least bit bored or have a moment to spare. I hate this, and yet <br>
      can’t seem to stop myself. I figure at least my brain patterns <br>
      were formed without this influence and am terrified of what <br>
      growing up with smartphones and tech will do to my daughter,” <br>
      wrote a New York City mom of a 1-year-old.
   </p>
   <p>
      When kids get older, they relish calling their parents out on that <br>
      hypocrisy. “Some apps and games can become a part of your life <br>
      and routines to the point where they become an obsession. My <br>
      kids call me out for being on my phone too much, and I have to <br>
      pull myself out of it and show them how you can set limits with <br>
      yourself and be present with the people in your life,” wrote <br>
      a psychologist and New York mom of three.
   </p>
   <p>
      “I asked my kids what they thought about smartphones. They <br>
      said that they must be really important, because the adults <br>
      looked at their screens all the time, and based on how frustrated <br>
      adults got when kids interrupted them, they assumed the <br>
      phones were more important than them, which was <br>
      heartbreakingly sad to hear,” wrote an engineer and mom of two <br>
      from New Hampshire.
   </p>
   <p>
      Many parents who answered our survey said that having kids <br>
      forced them to look more critically at how they use technology <br>
      and caused these parents to make a conscious effort to change. <br>
      “My wife and I have now made a pledge for complete ‘phone- <br>
      free’ activity for ourselves from the time we arrive home from <br>
      work until the children go to bed–no scrolling social media, no <br>
      email checking,” wrote a Chicago dad of three. <br>

      <h2>PARENTS ARE WORRIED ABOUT ADDICTION</h2>
    <p>
      With a lack of solid national data on the effects of all this tech exposure on <br>
      kids, parents definitely have a lot of concerns. In our unscientific survey, <br>
      only a blissed out 1% of parents expressed no concerns about their kids’ use <br>
      of tech.
   </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of our participants, nearly everyone (over 80%) communicated <br>
      concern about their kids becoming addicted and developing a shortened <br>
      attention span (likely because the parents are experiencing these problems <br>
      themselves). In our survey, addiction appears to trump the traditional <br>
      things we were told to fear on the internet, like sexual predators and online <br>
      bullying, which only concerned about half of parents who took part in our <br>
      survey. And data privacy is only a concern for a little more than half of <br>
      parents who took part in our questionnaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s definitely addictive behavior. And behavioral change is real. Wonder <br>
      what damage was done during a more permissive period that we can’t now <br>
      undo,” wrote a mom of two from Massachusetts of kids’ device habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      A New York mom of two describes the compulsive behavior she witnesses <br>
      in her daughter. “Monitoring screen time is exhausting and virtually <br>
      impossible. My 12-year-old daughter checks her phone constantly; she <br>
      doesn’t even know she’s doing it.”

    </p>
      <hr>
    <p>
      These parents’ concerns are backed up by research. A <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/news/press-releases/new-report-finds-teens-feel-addicted-to-their-phones-causing-tension-at">2016 survey from<br>
      Common Sense Media</a> found that 78% of teenagers check their devices at <br>
      least hourly, and half said that they thought they were addicted to their <br>
      phones. There is a lot of debate, however, over whether it is possible to <br>
      truly be addicted, in the clinical sense, to technology.

    <p>
      Some experts like Nicholas Kardaras, PhD, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glow-Kids-Screen-Addiction-Hijacking/dp/1250097991">Glow Kids: How<br>
      Screen Addiction Is Hijacking Our Kids</a>, believe categorically that the <br>
      behavior some kids and adults exhibit falls into the realm of addictive <br>
      behavior. In an interview for NPR with Kamenetz, he points to brain- <br>
      imaging studies that show the effects of screen time, and points to the <br>
      many teens he has treated who get so wrapped up in video games that they <br>
      don’t even get up to use the bathroom. To hear Kardaras tell it, the <br>
      evidence of technology’s addictive nature is obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kamenetz and Ana Homayoun, author of <a href="http://www.anahomayoun.com/books/">Social Media Wellness: Helping<br>
      Teens and Tweens Thrive in an Unbalanced Digital World</a>, take a more <br>
      cautious stance. Homayoun calls it “problematic overuse.” “I think that <br>
      covers a broader range of situations that you can deal with earlier,” she <br>
      explains. “Tech doesn’t have the same impact as something like opioids.” <br>
      She says that the signs of problematic overuse are similar to the traditional <br>
      signs of addiction, like withdrawing from friends and activities or becoming <br>
      angry or violent when the phone is take away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her solution? A digital detox: a family vacation over a long weekend to a <br>
      place without Wi-Fi. “It helps them get over the hump, and they come back <br>
      with a different relationship to it. They have to get through that initial <br>
      anxiety and through the other side.”

    <h2>  WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?</h2>
    <p>
    A constant refrain in our survey was how the near total saturation of tech in <br>
    schools made the entire idea of “screen time” much more nebulous. After <br>
    all, many schools (especially in more affluent districts) have introduced a <br>
    one-to-one program for kids with tablets or Chromebooks, some starting in <br>
    elementary school. Kamenetz points to research that has shown that kids <br>
    actually learn better in classrooms where two or three kids have to share <br>
    each device because that forces them to collaborate.
    </p>

    </p>
      <hr>
    <p>
      But regardless of kids’ use of tech in the classroom, nearly all kids are <br>
      required to check or complete their homework online, which means that <br>
      they will spend some of their time at home online. Several parents in our <br>
      survey feel like this means that putting limits on screen time is out of their <br>
      hands. “When the schools provided them with personal Chromebooks, it <br>
      become impossible to monitor or regulate what they were doing online,” <br>
      wrote a Minnesota dad of two.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think schools have generally done a poor job of educating parents on <br>
      tech-related topics, and many parents aren’t aware of tools and strategies <br>
      that they can employ to give their kids some structure when using tech,” <br>
      wrote an Illinois mom of two teens. Homayoun agrees with some of those <br>
      concerns. She says that in many cases, schools rush to put technology in <br>
      place without thinking about how it might impact kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way Homayoun sees it, the big missing skill is time management. “The <br>
      same tool that they need to use to complete their work is the same thing <br>
      that’s distracting them from getting work done,” she says of these digital <br>
      devices. Homayoun delivers school orientation programs to teach parents, <br>
      teachers, and students how to self-regulate and stay motivated. She <br>
      believes that setting limits on how long kids can be on devices, even if they <br>
      are using them to do homework, helps kids stay on task. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/section/time-management">Time management</a> <br>
      and distraction are issues that adults deal with daily–both at work and in <br>
      their personal lives. So Homayoun urges parents to approach their kids’ <br>
      struggles with device management from a place of empathy.
    </p>
      <h2>PARENTAL CONTROL</h2>
    <p>
     Most of the parents who answered our survey don’t use parental controls <br>
     on all the devices that their kids use. Sometimes this led to frightening <br>
     results, as one parent wrote: “I wish I was more ahead of the game on <br>
     knowing how to block certain sites. My sweet innocent daughter was <br>
     accidentally exposed to soft-core porn when looking for Barbie princess <br>
     videos online.”
   </p>
   <p>
     Parents might be skipping out of the parental controls because they don’t <br>
     trust them. As Homayoun points out, “Kids are smart and can find ways <br>
     around them.” She advises that rather than blocking or banning certain <br>
     sites or apps, parents should work to understand what their kids are using <br>
     and have a conversation with their children about their goals in visiting the <br>
     sites.
    </p>
    <p>
     That said, Homayoun recalls that many of the teens she works with confess <br>
     that they actually wish their parents would put more limits on their tech <br>
     use by doing things like not allowing them to use their phones in their <br>
     bedrooms at night (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40427741/you-might-not-feel-tired-but-your-brain-needs-more-sleep">something adults should also be doing to get more<br>
     sleep</a>).

    </p>
      <h2>REALISTIC LIMITS AND EXPECTATIONS</h2>
    <p>
     If there is one overarching theme to our survey and all of the current <br>
     research around kids’ use of tech, it’s this: We still don’t know.
   </p>
   <p>
     Victor Strasburger, coauthor of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ <br>
     guidelines for children’s use of media and technology, admitted to <br>
     Kamenetz that because of the lack of research, “We have no good idea <br>
     about what the media diet should be if you include computer time, <br>
     smartphones, iPads, that sort of thing. Maybe it’s four or five hours a day. <br>
     Maybe computer time for homework shouldn’t count, or does count. We <br>
     simply don’t know.”
   </p>
   <p>
     And that’s really the bottom line to this thorny conversation. Technology <br>
     has changed so rapidly in just the last 15 years, let alone since the time <br>
     today’s parents were kids themselves. Screen time often feels like the new <br>
     sugar: We fear it’s rotting our kids’ insides. And while it’s true that we need <br>
     more research to really understand how screen time is affecting kids’ <br>
     brains, Kamenetz asserts that tech isn’t an unknown toxin doing invisible <br>
     damage to kids. She believes that the negative effects of technology are <br>
     things parents can see, and that parents can apply common sense in order <br>
     to figure out how to mitigate the problems.
   </p>
   <p>
     Like most things in life, the solution might just be moderation. It may seem <br>
     like we are at a point of no return, but some families are finding their way <br>
     back, like this designer from Seattle who is a dad of four. He wrote of his <br>
     family, “For years, we were undisciplined [about] screen usage. They were <br>
     more tired, more moody, and generally less willing to engage in normal <br>
     childhood play. Now that we have seen those effects and pulled the screens <br>
     away, they are more engaged with each other, with us, their imagination <br>
     has come back dramatically, and the more analog life has also become <br>
     exciting again.”
   </p>
   <p>
     This is the approach Kamenetz recommends in her book. She says, “We <br>
     don’t have a set of solidly evidence-based recommendations that say, <br>
     ‘Healthy screen time looks like this.’ But I’ve come up with my own take on <br>
     Michael Pollen’s famous maxim: “Enjoy screens. Not too much. Mostly <br>
     with others.”
   </p>
   <p>
     And like any other behavior parents hope to impress on their kids <br>
     (manners, healthy eating habits, volunteering), parents’ actions make a <br>
     much bigger impact than their words.

   <h2>THE UPSIDE</h2>
   <p>
     Of course, not all tech use falls into the mindless games and social media <br>
     camp. As many parents pointed out, aptitude with technology is a crucial <br>
     skill for kids to succeed in school and in later careers.
   </p>
   <p>
     To that end, some of the parents helped get their kids excited about being <br>
     engaged with tech by sharing what they were doing when they were staring <br>
     at a screen. “I think her interest in technology stems from me working with <br>
     technology so closely. I’m always on my phone or computer. I make it a <br>
     point to explain what I am doing on the phone or computer, and allow her <br>
     to ask questions,” wrote a Palo Alto-based brand marketer and dad of a 5- <br>
     year-old.
  </p>
  <p>
     “The need to understand how to use technology and navigate the tech <br>
     world–this is not going away. It’s how they are learning in school and it’s <br>
     the workforce they’ll one day join. We are pushing STEM on our kids, yet <br>
     we freak out about them using technology and how it’s ruining their <br>
     childhood,” pointed out a Kansas City PR manager and mom of two. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
     The bulk of the conversations around kids and tech is about the dangers of <br>
     addiction, shortened attention spans, privacy, online bullying, depression, <br>
     and lack of empathy. But the saturation of technology in kids’ lives is <br>
     helping them in ways that weren’t possible a generation ago. Look no <br>
     further than the Parkland, Florida, teenagers who are using their social <br>
     media savvy to force a national conversation about gun control.

      The parents in our survey pointed to many other tangible <br>
      benefits. “My children can watch videos and listen to music <br>
      from anywhere in the world, listen to experts talk about their <br>
      given fields, learn how to code, learn another language, the list <br>
      goes on. None of that was available to me as a child. My <br>
      mom’s encyclopedia set was all I had. Australia was a 4-by-6- <br>
      inch black and white picture in a book. The other day, my <br>
      children Skyped with my brother who now lives there, and <br>
      they took a tour of Sydney, all from their phones,” explained a <br>
      Mississippi mom of four. “When used the right way, <br>
      technology can bridge gaps to provide information to anyone, <br>
      regardless of demographics.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m at the beginning of my parenting life. My son isn’t even 2 <br>
      years old. Who knows what tech we’ll be worried about by the <br>
      time he’s in high school, or what his concerns will be when he <br>
      becomes a parent. Like the parents in our survey, my plan is <br>
      to give him the tools he’ll need to succeed, and teach him the <br>
      best way to use them. And for now, I make sure that I save my <br>
      email checking for after he goes to bed.

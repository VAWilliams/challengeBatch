        </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Wash the basmati rice. Before you begin cooking, you need to wash the rice. Fill a large bowl with cold water and pour in the rice.<br>
          Use your hand to stir the rice in one direction. The water should get cloudy, so pour off the cloudy water. Refill the bowl with water.<br>
          Continue rinsing the rice until the water is clear. Washing the rice removes surface starches and any debris.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Soak the rice. After you have you rinsed the rice, soak it. Place the rice in a bowl of cold water and let it soak for 30 minutes to 2 hours.<br>
          Soaking the rice helps the grains expand and be fluffy. You can soak the rice in the water you plan on boiling it in.<br>
          If you do this, then the amount of water you need to use is 1.25 times the amount of rice. For 2 cups of rice, use 2 1/2 cups of water.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Chop the vegetables. If you are adding mixed vegetables, such as carrots, beans, tomatoes, cauliflower, or peas, cut them into smaller pieces.<br>
          Make sure you wash the vegetables and set them aside, ready to be added to your rice.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon to the pan. Sauté for a few seconds, then add onions.<br>
          Sauté until the onions turn transparent. Add tomatoes and cashew nuts after the onions turn translucent.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Add mint leaves, coriander leaves, and green chilies to the pan. Stir and Sauté for a minute or so. Then add the ginger and garlic paste.<br>
          Stir into the mixture in the pan, then Sauté for a couple of minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Add garam masala, chili powder, carrots, peas and beans. Sauté for a few more minutes, stirring regularly.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Pour in 8 cups of water. After adding the water, add salt to taste. Stir everything together, then bring the mixture to a boil.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Add the rice. Pour the rice into the boiling water. Add the lemon juice. Cover the pot with a tight lid. Let the rice cook until done.<br>
          The rice is done when it is al dente, not mushy.<br>
          As you check the rice, refrain from stirring. This will break the rice grains.<br>
          Add more water to the pot if you believe the water level is getting too low. Recover the rice and continue letting it cook.<br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Serve. Once the rice has cooked, serve the biryani hot. Try serving the biryani rice with rich curries or other delectable Indian main courses.
        </li>

        <strong>So, here's the thing:</strong><br>
        A Briyani recipe is as diverse as it gets. There are a variety to choose from. However, what I have shown is my own personal preferance,<br>
        so I don't want you to feel discouraged to try and experiment on different recipes.<br>
        Every meal should be a new experience, so I emplore you to get your creative juices flowing!

      <h1>Time for Acoustic</h1>

        <p>
          If you love the guitar as much as I do, I'm sure that there's not anything
          you would not do if it means embracing your baby in-between your arms.
          Now - the acoustic has been around for "quite some time", and it's
          influences are dramatically expanding. So, if you're one of those people
          who want to learn acoustic for popularity and attention - that's fine.
          At the end of your learning experience, you'll realise that it means much
          more than just an extention to your fanbase. It's one of those things
          who's value you only become aware of in due course.
